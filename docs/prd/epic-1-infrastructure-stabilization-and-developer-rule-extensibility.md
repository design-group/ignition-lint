# Epic 1: Infrastructure Stabilization and Developer Rule Extensibility

**Epic Goal**: Enable developers to easily contribute new linting rules by establishing reliable CI/CD infrastructure and implementing comprehensive rule registration system

**Integration Requirements**: All changes must maintain backward compatibility with existing rule implementations while providing clear migration path for enhanced extensibility features

## Story 1.1: Fix GitHub Actions Pipeline
As a **developer**,
I want **reliable GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline**,
so that **I can confidently contribute rules without breaking builds**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GitHub Actions workflow executes without errors
2. All linting checks pass in CI environment
3. Build process completes successfully
4. Test execution works in CI environment

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Existing CLI functionality remains intact after CI fixes
- **IV2**: Current rule implementations continue to work in CI environment
- **IV3**: Build time does not exceed previous baseline by more than 25%

## Story 1.2: Implement Local GitHub Actions Testing Tools
As a **developer**,
I want **local GitHub Actions testing capability**,
so that **I can validate workflows before committing changes**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Local GitHub Actions runner/simulator available
2. Full workflow can be tested locally
3. Documentation for local testing workflow provided
4. Integration with existing development workflow

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Local testing produces identical results to GitHub Actions environment
- **IV2**: Existing development commands remain functional
- **IV3**: Local testing setup does not interfere with existing Poetry workflow

## Story 1.3: Repair and Stabilize Automated Test Suite
As a **developer**,
I want **reliable automated test execution**,
so that **I can validate rule implementations with confidence**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. All existing tests pass consistently
2. Test runner executes without errors
3. Test coverage reporting works correctly
4. Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Existing rule implementations pass all tests
- **IV2**: CLI functionality verified through integration tests
- **IV3**: Test execution time remains within acceptable limits

## Story 1.4: Design and Implement Rule Registration System
As a **developer**,
I want **simple rule registration mechanism**,
so that **I can add new rules without modifying core framework code**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Rule registration API clearly defined and documented
2. Dynamic rule discovery mechanism implemented
3. Rule validation system prevents framework crashes
4. Configuration system supports new rules automatically

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Existing rules continue to function without modification
- **IV2**: Rule registration does not impact framework startup performance
- **IV3**: Configuration file compatibility maintained

## Story 1.5: Create Developer Documentation and Examples
As a **developer**,
I want **comprehensive rule development documentation**,
so that **I can contribute rules independently without framework expertise**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Rule development guide with step-by-step instructions
2. API documentation for rule registration system
3. Example rule implementations covering common patterns
4. Troubleshooting guide for rule development issues

**Integration Verification**:
- **IV1**: Documentation examples work with current framework version
- **IV2**: Rule development workflow integrates with existing project structure
- **IV3**: Example rules follow established visitor pattern architecture
