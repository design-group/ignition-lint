"""
Component structure and reference validation rules.

This package contains rules that validate component structure,
hierarchy, and references:
- Component reference validation
- Layout structure requirements
- Hierarchy depth limits
- Circular reference detection
- Container and child relationship validation

Rules in this category ensure that Ignition Perspective views
have valid structure and maintain proper component relationships.
They prevent common structural issues that can cause runtime
errors or unexpected behavior.

Structural validations include:
- Valid component references and paths
- Proper parent-child relationships
- Container layout constraints
- Binding target validation
- Cross-component dependency analysis
