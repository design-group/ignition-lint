"""
Performance-related rules for Ignition Perspective applications.

This package contains rules that identify performance issues and
optimization opportunities:
- Binding polling interval validation
- Resource usage pattern analysis
- Expensive operation detection
- Memory leak prevention
- Query optimization recommendations

Rules in this category help ensure Ignition applications run efficiently
and scale well under load. They detect common performance anti-patterns
and suggest optimizations.

Performance areas covered:
- Database query optimization
- Binding refresh rates and polling intervals
- Expression complexity and efficiency
- Resource allocation and cleanup
- Client-server communication patterns
