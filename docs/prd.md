# Ignition-Lint Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis

**Current Project State**: Ignition Lint is a Python framework for analyzing Ignition Perspective view.json files using an object model approach with visitor pattern rules. The framework provides CLI interface, extensible rule system, and object model for view components with comprehensive linting capabilities.

### Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**:
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (Python, Poetry, pytest)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (well-documented in CLAUDE.md)  
- ✅ Coding Standards (TDD approach, visitor pattern)
- ✅ API Documentation (CLI interface documented)
- ❌ UX/UI Guidelines (CLI-focused tool)
- ❌ Technical Debt Documentation (not explicitly documented)

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: 
- ✅ Bug Fix and Stability Improvements
- ✅ New Feature Addition

**Enhancement Description**: Correct existing technical debt including GitHub Actions and automated testing issues, then implement new user features that enhance system extensibility while maintaining the established visitor pattern architecture.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• Fix GitHub Actions pipeline to enable proper CI/CD workflow
• Add tooling for local GitHub Actions testing to prevent future CI failures
• Repair automated test suite to ensure reliable test execution
• Implement new user features that enhance system extensibility
• Maintain existing functionality while improving infrastructure reliability

**Background Context**: 
The ignition-lint framework has accumulated technical debt in its CI/CD infrastructure and testing systems that impedes development velocity and deployment reliability. The GitHub Actions are failing, and the automated test suite has execution issues. Simultaneously, there's demand for new extensibility features. This enhancement addresses infrastructure stability first, then adds value through expanded user capabilities, ensuring a solid foundation for future development.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: GitHub Actions pipeline must execute successfully with proper linting, testing, and build verification
**FR2**: Local GitHub Actions testing tools must be available to validate workflows before committing  
**FR3**: Automated test suite must run reliably with all existing tests passing consistently
**FR4**: Rule registration system must provide clear, documented path for developers to add new rules to the framework
**FR5**: New rule registration must integrate seamlessly with existing visitor pattern rule architecture
**FR6**: System must maintain backward compatibility with existing rule implementations during infrastructure fixes
**FR7**: Enhanced rule extensibility must provide clear APIs and comprehensive documentation for rule developers
**FR8**: Rule discovery and loading mechanism must automatically detect and register new developer-contributed rules

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Infrastructure fixes must not break existing CLI functionality or rule execution performance
**NFR2**: Test execution time must not increase by more than 25% after infrastructure corrections
**NFR3**: GitHub Actions pipeline must complete within reasonable CI time limits (< 10 minutes typical)
**NFR4**: New extensibility features must follow established Python coding standards and TDD practices
**NFR5**: Rule development documentation must be comprehensive enough for developers to contribute rules independently
**NFR6**: Rule registration system must have minimal performance overhead on framework initialization

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Existing rule implementations must continue to function without modification after infrastructure fixes
**CR2**: CLI interface backward compatibility must be maintained throughout enhancement process
**CR3**: Configuration file formats must remain compatible with existing user configurations  
**CR4**: Python version compatibility must be preserved per current project requirements

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.x
**Frameworks**: Poetry (dependency management), pytest (testing), pylint (code quality)
**Database**: N/A (file-based JSON analysis)
**Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions (CI/CD), CLI-based execution
**External Dependencies**: Standard Python libraries, JSON processing utilities

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: N/A - file-based analysis system
**API Integration Strategy**: Maintain CLI interface as primary API, ensure rule registration doesn't break existing CLI contract
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: CLI-focused with potential for programmatic integration via Python imports
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing pytest framework to cover rule registration system and new developer-contributed rules

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: New rules must integrate with existing `src/ignition_lint/rules/` directory structure while supporting dynamic discovery
**Naming Conventions**: Follow established Python PEP 8 standards and existing project patterns (CamelCase for rule classes)
**Coding Standards**: Maintain TDD approach, visitor pattern implementation, comprehensive docstrings for developer-facing APIs
**Documentation Standards**: Developer rule contribution guide, API documentation, example rule implementations

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: GitHub Actions must validate both core framework and any contributed rules through comprehensive testing
**Deployment Strategy**: PyPI package distribution with rule discovery mechanism that works in installed environments
**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing logging to cover rule registration and execution for debugging developer contributions
**Configuration Management**: Rule configuration system must support new rules without breaking existing configurations

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Rule registration system could introduce performance overhead
- Dynamic rule discovery might create security vulnerabilities
- Poorly written developer rules could crash the framework

**Integration Risks**:
- GitHub Actions fixes might conflict with rule testing requirements
- Test infrastructure changes could break existing rule validation

**Deployment Risks**:
- Rule discovery mechanism might fail in different Python environments
- Package distribution could complicate rule installation workflow

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement rule validation and sandboxing for contributed rules
- Create comprehensive test suite covering rule registration edge cases
- Provide local GitHub Actions testing to prevent CI failures
- Design rule registration with fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale

For this brownfield enhancement, I recommend a single epic structure because:
1. **Infrastructure dependencies**: GitHub Actions and testing fixes are prerequisites for reliable rule development workflow
2. **Integrated delivery**: Developer extensibility is the primary value, with infrastructure as enabling foundation
3. **Risk management**: Sequential delivery ensures stable platform before opening to developer contributions
4. **Cohesive scope**: All work serves the unified goal of enabling developer rule contributions

## Epic 1: Infrastructure Stabilization and Developer Rule Extensibility

**Epic Goal**: Enable developers to easily contribute new linting rules by establishing reliable CI/CD infrastructure and implementing comprehensive rule registration system
