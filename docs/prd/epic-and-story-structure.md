# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale

For this brownfield enhancement, I recommend a single epic structure because:
1. **Infrastructure dependencies**: GitHub Actions and testing fixes are prerequisites for reliable rule development workflow
2. **Integrated delivery**: Developer extensibility is the primary value, with infrastructure as enabling foundation
3. **Risk management**: Sequential delivery ensures stable platform before opening to developer contributions
4. **Cohesive scope**: All work serves the unified goal of enabling developer rule contributions
