# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.x
**Frameworks**: Poetry (dependency management), pytest (testing), pylint (code quality)
**Database**: N/A (file-based JSON analysis)
**Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions (CI/CD), CLI-based execution
**External Dependencies**: Standard Python libraries, JSON processing utilities

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: N/A - file-based analysis system
**API Integration Strategy**: Maintain CLI interface as primary API, ensure rule registration doesn't break existing CLI contract
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: CLI-focused with potential for programmatic integration via Python imports
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing pytest framework to cover rule registration system and new developer-contributed rules

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: New rules must integrate with existing `src/ignition_lint/rules/` directory structure while supporting dynamic discovery
**Naming Conventions**: Follow established Python PEP 8 standards and existing project patterns (CamelCase for rule classes)
**Coding Standards**: Maintain TDD approach, visitor pattern implementation, comprehensive docstrings for developer-facing APIs
**Documentation Standards**: Developer rule contribution guide, API documentation, example rule implementations

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: GitHub Actions must validate both core framework and any contributed rules through comprehensive testing
**Deployment Strategy**: PyPI package distribution with rule discovery mechanism that works in installed environments
**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing logging to cover rule registration and execution for debugging developer contributions
**Configuration Management**: Rule configuration system must support new rules without breaking existing configurations

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Rule registration system could introduce performance overhead
- Dynamic rule discovery might create security vulnerabilities
- Poorly written developer rules could crash the framework

**Integration Risks**:
- GitHub Actions fixes might conflict with rule testing requirements
- Test infrastructure changes could break existing rule validation

**Deployment Risks**:
- Rule discovery mechanism might fail in different Python environments
- Package distribution could complicate rule installation workflow

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement rule validation and sandboxing for contributed rules
- Create comprehensive test suite covering rule registration edge cases
- Provide local GitHub Actions testing to prevent CI failures
- Design rule registration with fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies
