# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1**: GitHub Actions pipeline must execute successfully with proper linting, testing, and build verification
**FR2**: Local GitHub Actions testing tools must be available to validate workflows before committing
**FR3**: Automated test suite must run reliably with all existing tests passing consistently
**FR4**: Rule registration system must provide clear, documented path for developers to add new rules to the framework
**FR5**: New rule registration must integrate seamlessly with existing visitor pattern rule architecture
**FR6**: System must maintain backward compatibility with existing rule implementations during infrastructure fixes
**FR7**: Enhanced rule extensibility must provide clear APIs and comprehensive documentation for rule developers
**FR8**: Rule discovery and loading mechanism must automatically detect and register new developer-contributed rules

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Infrastructure fixes must not break existing CLI functionality or rule execution performance
**NFR2**: Test execution time must not increase by more than 25% after infrastructure corrections
**NFR3**: GitHub Actions pipeline must complete within reasonable CI time limits (< 10 minutes typical)
**NFR4**: New extensibility features must follow established Python coding standards and TDD practices
**NFR5**: Rule development documentation must be comprehensive enough for developers to contribute rules independently
**NFR6**: Rule registration system must have minimal performance overhead on framework initialization

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Existing rule implementations must continue to function without modification after infrastructure fixes
**CR2**: CLI interface backward compatibility must be maintained throughout enhancement process
**CR3**: Configuration file formats must remain compatible with existing user configurations
**CR4**: Python version compatibility must be preserved per current project requirements
