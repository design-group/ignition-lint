# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis

**Current Project State**: Ignition Lint is a Python framework for analyzing Ignition Perspective view.json files using an object model approach with visitor pattern rules. The framework provides CLI interface, extensible rule system, and object model for view components with comprehensive linting capabilities.

## Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**:
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (Python, Poetry, pytest)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (well-documented in CLAUDE.md)  
- ✅ Coding Standards (TDD approach, visitor pattern)
- ✅ API Documentation (CLI interface documented)
- ❌ UX/UI Guidelines (CLI-focused tool)
- ❌ Technical Debt Documentation (not explicitly documented)

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: 
- ✅ Bug Fix and Stability Improvements
- ✅ New Feature Addition

**Enhancement Description**: Correct existing technical debt including GitHub Actions and automated testing issues, then implement new user features that enhance system extensibility while maintaining the established visitor pattern architecture.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes required)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• Fix GitHub Actions pipeline to enable proper CI/CD workflow
• Add tooling for local GitHub Actions testing to prevent future CI failures
• Repair automated test suite to ensure reliable test execution
• Implement new user features that enhance system extensibility
• Maintain existing functionality while improving infrastructure reliability

**Background Context**: 
The ignition-lint framework has accumulated technical debt in its CI/CD infrastructure and testing systems that impedes development velocity and deployment reliability. The GitHub Actions are failing, and the automated test suite has execution issues. Simultaneously, there's demand for new extensibility features. This enhancement addresses infrastructure stability first, then adds value through expanded user capabilities, ensuring a solid foundation for future development.
